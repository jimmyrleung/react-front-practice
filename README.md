# React Front Practice

Front-end practice with ReactJS üî•

## Setup
I've used [express-base-api](https://github.com/jimmyrleung/express-base-api) as back-end service, so if you want to run this project rightly you should run the api too (don't worry, it's very easy to set the api up).

## Already implemented

* Full react-hooks structure (functional components only and custom hooks)
* Environment config using .env
* Type-checking with TypeScript
* Import/exports barrel pattern with SystemJS
* Routing using react-router-dom
* Private components with authentication HOC
* Basic session management using local storage
* HTTP Requests with Axios
* Common components folder with custom components

## Coming up soon

* Sass configuration
* React context
* Custom alerts

### Discarded

Nothing to show here üôè
